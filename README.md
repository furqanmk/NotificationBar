**NotificationBar** is a simple module that allows you to show notifications or alerts. It's simple to use yet very customizable. Just make an instance and call a method to show, that's it!

## Installation

#### Cocoapods
Paste the following line to your Podfile:
```ruby
pod 'NotificationBar', :git => 'https://github.com/furqanmk/NotificationBar.git'
```
CocoaPods release coming soon.

#### Manual
Drag and drop files from the `Source` folder.

## Usage

Make an instance of `NotificationBar` with desired properties in the initializer and `show()` method. Don't forget to call the `dismiss()` method if you passed `.loading` for style in the init.

```swift
NotificationBar(over: self, text: "Here goes your message", style: .success).show()
```

### Customizations

#### NotificationBarConfiguration

You can set the following properties on `NotificationBar.sharedConfig` which will then be applied on all NotificationBar instances thereafter:

- `duration`: Duration after which auto dismissed notification bar is dismissed
- `font`: The default font of the text
- `textColor`: The color of the text
- `padding`: Padding around the text
- `loadingColor`: Default background color for `.loading` style
- `successColor`: Default background color for `.sucess` style
- `errorColor`: Default color for `.error` style

#### Custom NotificationBarStyle

You can provide a custom style in the initializer by providing an instance of `NotificationBarStyle.VisualConfig` using `NotificationBarStyle.custom`.

```swift
let customConfig = NotificationBarStyle.VisualConfig(backgroundColor: .gray,
                                                     isLoaderHidden: true,
                                                     dismiss: .auto)
NotificationBar(over: self, text: "Some text", style: .custom(customConfig))
```

#### NotificationBarDismiss

It's important to remember that if the dismiss property of the NotificationBar is set to `.manual`, the user must also call `dismiss()` on the NotificationBar. Style `.loading` has a dismiss property of `.manual`.
